        <h2 class="blog-post__title">HELLO WORLD</h2>
        <p class="blog-post__paragraph">
            Starting a blog has been on my to-do list for a while. I put it off for so long because I wasn't sure exactly what I wanted to blog about.  I'm passionate about cooking, music festivals, software engineering, and yoga, and I thought I needed to pick a lane.  I tried to come up with a good blog name for any of those topics and I never landed on anything.  Finally, one day I realized I could just use my name as a pun and it allows me to post about any and all of those topics.
        </p>
        <h3 class="blog-post__sub-title">
            So, a little bit about me and what I'll post about ...
        </h3>
        <p class="blog-post__paragraph">
            I'm a former high school science teacher, current software engineer, and yoga instructor. In my spare time, I like to play video games, cook, bake, and (when real-life returns) go to as many concerts and music festivals as I can. I'll start out by posting mainly about how I transitioned from teacher to tech and the things I've learned along the way. I plan to post some tutorials for anyone interested in web development. Then, as I'm inspired, I'll branch out into my other interests and post about events.
        </p>
        <h3 class="blog-post__sub-title">
            Why do I want to start a blog?
        </h3>
        <p class="blog-post__paragraph">
            I love reading about other people's experiences and I'd like to share my own.  My main motivator is to share my story of breaking into tech as a career switcher, a woman, and a minority.  This is also an opportunity for me to learn about purchasing a domain and setting it up and how it all works.  I didn't go with WordPress or any other ready-made templates or existing platforms.  Right now this blog just a bunch of html pages linked together on github pages.  Once I create enough posts I'm sure I'll build out a proper back end and make it into a real application with comments and I may add in a fancy javascript framework if I feel like it, but for now, this is good enough for me.  If you stick around you'll get to read all about it!
