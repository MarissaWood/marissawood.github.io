        <h2 class="blog-post__title">FROM TEACHER TO TECH - PART 1</h2>
        <p class="blog-post__paragraph">
            I currently work as a software engineer, but before my leap into tech, I spent 5 years as a high school physics teacher.  During that time I picked up additional roles and responsibilities such as Science Department Chair, Junior Class Sponsor (in charge of planning prom ðŸ˜©), and Physics Club Sponsor. There were many things I loved about teaching, but ultimately I quit because, for me, it wasn't fulfilling enough to put up with all of the bad stuff for a very mediocre salary and restrictive schedule. Yes, teachers get summers off, but you basically can't take any time off during the school year. I would feel super burned out for 9 months and then very quickly get bored over the summer break.  It felt like the worst of both worlds. I could go on and on, but I'll sum it up with <strong>seven reasons I quit teaching</strong> and tie it to parts 2 and 3 of this series with <strong> three reasons I chose software as my next move</strong>. If you are reading this because you find yourself in a similar place of wanting to quit teaching but not knowing what comes next maybe this series will help you take the leap and find your next move whether it lies in technology or not.

            It's not all bad
        </h3>
        <p class="blog-post__paragraph">
            Before I go into all the reasons I ultimately quit, I do want to mention some of the good parts of the job.  In those five years, I met a lot of interesting people.  I'm not sure there are many other jobs where you can make real connections with 100+ new people every year.  I gained a lot of confidence in presenting and public speaking. That's a very useful skill to have in any job.
            <br>
            <br>
            My first year of teaching was <strong>hard</strong>.  I made it harder on myself by also planning an out of state wedding; but even though it was hard, I loved it.  I'll always remember that first group of kids.  They were a handful but I've got a lot of love for that group of students. The challenges were expected and I ended the year feeling hopeful for the future.  I learned a lot and sent some of my favorite students (yes, of course, we have favorites) off to my alma mater.

            The Seven Reasons I Quit
        </h3>
        <p class="blog-post__paragraph">
            This list won't be all-inclusive, but these are the big things that kept slowly eating away at my motivation and willingness to return to the job.  These are probably things I should have thought critically about before I went down the road to becoming a teacher, but I made that decision when I was 19 and I didn't know they were deal breakers until I was already a few years into my career. Once I had already sunk my time and effort into getting a master's degree I felt trapped in my decision. I observed that many teachers fall into this trap of convincing themselves that they don't have a choice or that it's too hard to start over while also growing more and more resentful of their jobs and I didn't want to end up like that. Anyway, reason number 1...

            1. What do you mean I have to buy my own dry erase markers?
        </h3>
        <p class="blog-post__paragraph">
            Teaching is the one job where you steal supplies from yourself and bring them to work.  In the beginning, I would pay for the things I wanted to use in class thinking of them as investments that I would continue to use in the future (lol).  But things break, teenagers are clumsy and/or purposefully destructive and I eventually decided that I shouldn't have to pay for the materials to do my job.  Unfortunately, this resulted in my classes gradually getting less fun year after year.
        </p>
        <h3 class="blog-post__sub-title">
            2. Pay Schedules
        </h3>
        <p class="blog-post__paragraph">
            Some people like the predictability of pay schedules.  It (mostly) guarantees a raise<sup>1</sup> every year, but I found them very demotivating. I just had to make sure I didn't get fired and I'd know how much I would make the following year.  It didn't matter how many letters of recommendation that I wrote that helped my students get into top-tier schools and land great scholarships. It didn't matter how many of my students got 5's on their AP exams. Teaching just doesn't have a way of consistently rewarding high-performing teachers. So, I started to look elsewhere to a different career path that would reward me for all my hard work.
        </p>
        <h3 class="blog-post__sub-title">
            3. General disrespect from students
        </h3>
        <p class="blog-post__paragraph">
            In general, throughout my teaching career, I had a great rapport with my students.  I genuinely liked them as people and there was a lot of mutual respect. But even with an overall positive experience, teenagers can be real jerks.  They try to get away with everything.  They lie straight to your face.  They get mad at you when you won't bend the rules for them.  They say things in anger.  At my first high school, usually, when a kid was being unreasonable, they would realize they were in the wrong and apologize the next day or when they got detention, but at my second school, a kid would act crazy and then look at me like I was the one being the asshole.  That's not to say I hate teenagers, but when you spend your entire working hours surrounded by them and most of your stress comes from them, it builds up over time.
        </p>
        <h3 class="blog-post__sub-title">
            4. General disrespect from parents
        </h3>
        <p class="blog-post__paragraph">
            Some parents make being a teacher a horrible experience because they blame you for a lot of things that you don't have any control over, and occasionally they put way too much faith in the words of a 17-year-old who doesn't want to get grounded over an adult. There's a finite number of times I can tolerate a parent accusing me of lying (over mundane things that didn't even matter in the grand scheme of things by the way) and I reached my limit.
        </p>
        <h3 class="blog-post__sub-title">
            5. Inability to take time off when you need it
        </h3>
        <p class="blog-post__paragraph">
            People always act like a teacher's schedule is so nice because they get summers off, but during the school year, they regularly work up to 12 hour days, bring work home with them, and can't ever really take time off when they need or want it. Get invited to Germany to do Oktoberfest with your friends? Your cousin is getting married in Italy? Too bad, can't go. As a teacher, you both can't take the time off and probably can't afford to go anyway.
            <br>
            <br>
            At my first school, we got three personal days a year. At my second job we didn't get any personal days, only sick days.  I barely even used my sick days because it was more work to set up plans for a substitute than it is to just come into school and teach.  With a schedule where I only see my students every other day, taking a day off usually sets back progress a lot, so I never felt like I could take a day off without being stressed out the entire time.

            6. I didn't want to enforce rules I didn't believe in
        </h3>
        <p class="blog-post__paragraph">
            I do not care about dress codes.  I'm actually pretty against them. I hate how they restrict the creative expression of girls and don't address the fact that we should just be teaching young men to be respectful.  So I (mostly) just didn't bother enforcing them.  There were a lot of stupid rules and systems in place that were ineffective, illogical, or even harmful.  It was my job to enforce these rules and I hated it.  Doing my job would erode away at the relationships I built with my students because they would view me as the bad guy.  We had a policy at my first school where seniors were exempt from their finals if they maintained an A and only missed 3 classes (the exact details are a little fuzzy at this point but something close to that is probably accurate). Sounds like a great idea at first.  But, enforcing this one rule was the bane of my existence. As you can imagine, 17 and 18-year-olds would throw an absolute fit if they missed 4 classes and didn't qualify and act like I was personally punishing them for not making an exception.  It didn't help that other teachers would make exceptions, but that just leads to more unfairness and bias in deciding who gets an exception so I just enforced the rules like I was supposed to.  I had some students take physics in their junior year, and almost all of them would qualify if they were just a year older so they felt like they were being punished for overachieving.  The whole thing sucked.
        </p>
        <h3 class="blog-post__sub-title">
            7. Most of my time wasn't actually spent teaching
        </h3>
        <p class="blog-post__paragraph">
            The actual time spent teaching versus doing other things as a teacher isn't as high as most people think.  More time is spent planning, grading, and in meetings than actual time in front of a class. Even when you are leading a class, a large portion of your energy is spent on behavior management rather than teaching.

            Three reasons I chose software engineering as my next move.
        </h3>
        <p class="blog-post__paragraph">
            I spent a lot of time thinking about what to do next.  I needed a solid plan to get out of teaching, it's not like I saved up a lot of money to be able to take a break and then figure it out. It was scary throwing away all those years of experience and all the career progress I made.  I'm not sure exactly what the breaking point was, I just knew I needed out.  So a lot of soul searching and research eventually led me to pursue software development, and here is reason number 1...
        </p>
        <h3 class="blog-post__sub-title">
            1. Honestly, the pay
        </h3>
        <p class="blog-post__paragraph">
            Tech salaries are waaaayyyyy better than anything I'd ever make as a teacher.  I like having nice things.  I enjoy taking trips.  Being a teacher would never allow me to have the kind of life I want. I think it's a total scam that we expect teachers to solve all of society's problems while paying mediocre salaries and expecting them to have master's degrees. It's just not worth it. This is a reason a lot of people pursue a career in tech, but it's important to choose a job where you'll be challenged and fulfilled. Which leads me to reason number 2...
        </p>
        <h3 class="blog-post__sub-title">
            2. I find problem solving is fun
        </h3>
        <p class="blog-post__paragraph">
            One thing I really enjoyed about physics is problem solving and I'm still able to apply that skill in coding. When I'm doing something I enjoy, it doesn't feel like a grind.  Coding is hard, but there is always a solution.  There's usually more than one solution.  I find it very satisfying to work through them.
        </p>
        <h3 class="blog-post__sub-title">
            3. It's a job that allows me to be both technical and creative
        </h3>
        <p class="blog-post__paragraph">
            Growing up I felt like I had to be either analytical or creative but I eventually realized that I need to exercise both of those skills to be fulfilled.  Web development is the perfect intersection of those for me.  I love the visual aspect of front end and enjoy the puzzle of coding in less visual languages.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-post__paragraph">
            In my next post, I'll get more into why I chose a bootcamp instead of self-education or going back to get another degree and my bootcamp experience.

            <p><sup>1</sup> in reality sometimes the overall compensation year over year was worse instead of better when they cut benefits or raised insurance costs.
