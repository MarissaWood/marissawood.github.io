        <h2 class="blog-post__title">FROM TEACHER TO TECH - PART 1</h2>
        <p class="blog-post__paragraph">
            I currently work as a software engineer, but before my leap into tech, I spent 5 years as a high school physics teacher.  During that time I picked up additional roles and responsibilities such as Science Department Chair, Junior Class Sponsor (in charge of planning prom ðŸ˜©), and Physics Club Sponsor. There were many things I loved about teaching, but ultimately I quit because, for me, it wasn't fulfilling enough to put up with all of the bad stuff for a very mediocre salary and restrictive schedule. Yes, teachers get summers off, but you basically can't take any time off during the school year. I would feel super burned out for 9 months and then very quickly get bored over the summer break.  It felt like the worst of both worlds. I could go on and on, but I'll sum it up with <strong>seven reasons I quit teaching</strong> and tie it to parts 2 and 3 of this series with <strong> three reasons I chose software as my next move</strong>. If you are reading this because you find yourself in a similar place of wanting to quit teaching but not knowing what comes next maybe this will help you take the leap and find your next move whether it lies in technology or not.

            It's not all bad
        </h3>
        <p class="blog-post__paragraph">
            Before I go into all the reasons I ultimately quit, I do want to mention the good parts of the job.  I lasted five years, that's not nothing. To give a little background I majored in physics in college and somewhere along the way decided that I wanted to keep doing physics somehow in my job but I decided I didn't want to do research after a summer reseach intership, so I landed on teaching. Throughout high school I had been a camp counselor and tutor and figured it would be a good fit for my personality.  So I applied for a program that would allow me to concurrently complete my bachelors in physics and masters in secondary science education in 5 years and put myself on the path to becoming a teacher. My first year of teaching was <strong>hard</strong>.  I made it harder on myself by also planning a Long Island wedding while living in Virginia; but even though it was hard, I loved it. The challenges were expected and I ended the year feeling hopeful for the future.  I learned a lot and sent some of my favorite students off to my alma mater. I sat in the final staff meeting of the year and clapped for my coworkers as they collected their 5-year pins and other accolades and pictured myself staying at that high school for a long time. It's funny how quickly things can change.

            The Seven reasons I quit
        </h3>
        <p class="blog-post__paragraph">
            These won't be all inclusive, but they are the big things that just kept nagging at me and slowly eating away at my motivation and willingness to return to the job.  These are probably things I should have really thought critically about before I went down the road to becoming a teacher, but I didn't know they were deal breakers until I was already into it. Once I had already sunk my time and effort into getting a masters I felt trapped in my decision. I observed that many teachers fall into this trap of convincing themselves that they don't really have a choice or that it's too hard to start over while also growing more and more resentful of their jobs and I didn't want to end up like that.  I think we've all had at least one teacher in our k12 education who had been teaching for 20+ years but seemed to hate their job.  Anyway reason number 1...
        </p>
        <h3 class="blog-post__sub-title">
            1. What do you mean I have to buy my own dry erase markers?
        </h3>
        <p class="blog-post__paragraph">
            Teachers having to pay for their own supplies isn't just absurd, but I found it extremely frustrating and limiting for my lessons.  I love doing things hands on and have some sort of visual demonstration because that's how science can really come alive and get kids interested.  In the beginning I would pay for the things I wanted to use in class thinking of them as investments that I would continue to use in the future (lol).  But things break, teenagers are clumsy and/or assholes and I decided that I shouldn't have to pay for the materials to do my job.  Unforutately, this resulted in my classes gradually getting less fun year after year.
        </p>

            2. Pay Schedules
        </h3>
        <p class="blog-post__paragraph">
            If you aren't working in a public k12 school, you probably don't know the details of how teachers are paid, so I'll give a brief explanation.  There is a table based on how long you've been teaching and what type of degree you have.  Every year you move up one step (unless there's some sort of step freeze due to budget, which never happened to me, but I've heard it can be pretty common in certain districts).  Some people might like the predictable, mostly guaranteed raise every year, but I hated how no matter how hard I worked, no matter how good I did my job, I would never be monetarily rewarded for that effort.  I basically just had to make sure I didn't get fired and I'd get the same raise.  It didn't matter how many letters of recommendation that I wrote that helped my students get into top tier schools and land really great scholarships. I found that system extremely demotivating.  Teaching just does not have a way of consistently rewarding high performing teachers. So, I started to look elsewhere to a different career path that would reward me for all my hard work.

            3. General disrespect from students
        </h3>
        <p class="blog-post__paragraph">
            In general, over the course of my teaching career, I had great rapport with my students.  I genuinely liked them as people and there was a lot of mutual respect. But even with an overall positive experience, teenagers can be real jerks.  They try to get away with everything.  They lie straight to your face.  They get mad at you when you won't bend the rules for them.  They say things in anger.  At my first high school, usually when a kid was being an unreasonable, they would realize they were in the wrong and apologize the next day or when they got detention, but at my second school, a kid would act crazy and then look at me like I was the one being the asshole.  That's not to say I hate teenagers, but when you spend your entire working hours surrounded by them and most of your stress comes from them, it builds up over time.
        </p>
        <h3 class="blog-post__sub-title">
            4. General disrespect from parents
        </h3>
        <p class="blog-post__paragraph">
            In some ways, the disrespect from students is expected and even tolerated because, most of us are assholes when we were that age, but when parents get nasty, it's really difficult to deal with.  I won't get into details but some parents really make being a teacher a horrible experience because they blame you for a lot of things that you don't have any control over and occasionally they put way too much faith in the words of a 17 year old who doesn't want to get grounded over an adult. Theres a finite number of times I can tolerate a parent accusing me of lying and I reached my limit.
        </p>
        <h3 class="blog-post__sub-title">
            5. Inability to take time off when you need it
        </h3>
        <p class="blog-post__paragraph">
            People always act like a teacher's schedule is so nice because they get summers off, but during the school year they regularly work up to 12 hour days, bring work home with them and can't ever really take time off when they need it or want it. Get invited to Germany to do Oktoberfest with your friends? Your cousin is getting married in Italy? Too bad, can't go. As a teacher you both can't take the time off and probably can't really afford to go anyway.
            <br>
            At my first school, we got three personal days a year. At my second job we didn't get any personal days, only sick days.  I usually just worked through it when I got sick because it was more work to set up plans for a substitute than it is it just come into school and teach.  With a subject like physics, and with a schedule where I only see my students every other day, taking a day off usually sets back progress a lot.  No offense to the substitute teachers at my schools but its pretty hard to teach physics.
        </p>
        <h3 class="blog-post__sub-title">
            6. I didn't want to have to enforce rules I didn't believe in
        </h3>
        <p class="blog-post__paragraph">
            I really do not care about enforcing dress codes.  I hate how they restrict the creative expression of girls and largely leave boys alone.  So I (mostly) just didn't do it.  There were a lot of stupid rules and systems in place that were ineffective, illogical or even harmful.  It was my job to enforce these rules and I hated it.  Doing my job would erode away at the relationships I built with my students because they would view me as the bad guy.  We had another policy where seniors were exempt from their finals if they maintained an A and only missed 3 classes (the exact details are a little fuzzy at this point but something close to that is probably accurate).  Enforcing this one rule was the bane of my existence. As you can imagine, 17 and 18 year olds would throw an absolute fit if they missed 4 classes and didn't qualify and act like I was personally punishing them for not making an exeption.  It didn't help that other teachers would make exceptions, but that just leads to more unfairness and bias in deciding who gets an exception so I just followed the rules as they were written.  I also had some students take physics in their junior year, and almost all of them would qualify if they were just a year older so they felt like they were being punished for overachieving.  The whole thing sucked.

        <h3 class="blog-post__sub-title">
            7. Most of my time wasn't actually spent teaching
        </h3>
        <p class="blog-post__paragraph">
            The actual time spent teaching versus doing other things as a teacher isn't as high as most people imagine.  More time is spent planning, grading and in meetings than actual time in front of a class. Even when you are leading a class, a large portion of your energy is spent on behavior management rather than teaching.

            Three reasons I chose software engineering as my next move.
        </h3>
        <p class="blog-post__paragraph">
            I spent a lot of time thinking about what to do next.  I needed a solid plan in order to actually get out of teaching, it's not like I saved up a lot of money to be able to take a break and then figure it out. It was scary throwing away all those years of experience and all the career progress I made.  I'm not sure exactly what the breaking point was, I just knew I needed out.  So a lot of soul sreaching and research eventually led me to pursue software development, and here is reason number 1.
        </p>
        <h3 class="blog-post__sub-title">
            1. Honestly, the pay
        </h3>
        <p class="blog-post__paragraph">
            Tech salaries are waaaayyyyy better than anything I'd ever make as a teacher.  I like having nice things.  I enjoy taking trips.  Being a teacher would never allow me to have the kind of life I want. I think it's a total scam that we expect teachers to solve all of societies problems while paying mediocre salaries and expecting them to have master's degrees. It's just not worth it.
        </p>
        <h3 class="blog-post__sub-title">
            2. Problem solving is fun
        </h3>
        <p class="blog-post__paragraph">
            One thing I really enjoyed about physics is problem solving and I'm still able to apply that skill in coding. When I'm doing something I enjoy, it doesn't feel like a grind.  Coding is hard, but there is always a solution.  There's usually more than one solution.  I find it very satisfying to work through them.
        </p>
        <h3 class="blog-post__sub-title">
            3. It's a job that allows me to be both technical and creative
        </h3>
        <p class="blog-post__paragraph">
            Growing up I felt like I had to be either analytical or creative but I eventually realized that I need to exercise both of those skills in order to be fulfilled.  Web development is the perfect intersection of those for me.  I love the visual aspect of front end and enjoy the puzzle of coding in less visual languages.
