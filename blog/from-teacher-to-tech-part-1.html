        <h2 class="blog-post__title">FROM TEACHER TO TECH - PART 1</h2>
        <p class="blog-post__paragraph">
            I currently work as a software engineer, but you may not know that before my time in tech, I spent 5 years as a high school physics teacher.  There were many things I loved about teaching, but ultimately I quit because, for me, it wasn't fulfilling enough to put up with all of the bad stuff for a very mediocre salary<sup>1</sup> and restrictive schedule. Yes, teachers get summers off, but you basically can't take any time off during the school year. I would feel super burned out for 9 months and then very quickly get bored over the summer break.  It felt like the worst of both worlds. I could go on and on, but I'll sum it up with <strong>seven reasons I quit teaching</strong> and tie it to parts <a href="/blog/from-teacher-to-tech-part-2">2</a> and <a href="/blog/from-teacher-to-tech-part-3">3</a> of this series with <strong> three reasons I chose software as my next move</strong>. If you are reading this because you find yourself in a similar place of wanting to quit teaching but not knowing what comes next maybe this series will help you take the leap and find your next move whether it lies in technology or not.

            It's not all bad
        </h3>
        <p class="blog-post__paragraph">
            Before I go into all the reasons I ultimately quit, I do want to mention some of the good parts of the job.  In those five years, I met a lot of interesting people.  I'm not sure there are many other jobs where you can make real connections with 100+ new people every year.  I miss my old coworkers, I miss mentoring students in their final year of high school before they go off to college.  It's an exciting and important time.  I also gained a lot of confidence in presenting and public speaking. Those are very useful skills to have in any job.
            <br>
            <br>
            My first year of teaching was <strong>hard</strong>.  I made it harder on myself by also planning an out of state wedding; but even though it was hard, I loved it.  I'll always remember that first group of kids.  They were a handful but I've got a lot of love for that group of students. The challenges were expected and I ended the year feeling hopeful for the future.  I learned a lot and sent some of my favorite students off to my alma mater.

            The Seven Reasons I Quit
        </h3>
        <p class="blog-post__paragraph">
            This list won't be all-inclusive, but these are the big things that kept slowly eating away at my motivation and willingness to return to the job.  Are they similar to most other lists you might read on other 'Why I quit Teaching' blogs? Maybe.  I read a lot of those while I was mulling over my own decision to quit and every one has a slightly different story. So I'm just adding my voice and my experience.  These are probably things I should have thought critically about before I went down the road to becoming a teacher, but I made that decision when I was 19 and I didn't know they were deal breakers until I was already a few years into my career. Once I had already sunk my time and effort into getting a master's degree I felt trapped in my decision. I observed that many teachers fall into this trap of convincing themselves that they don't have a choice or that it's too hard to start over while also growing more and more resentful of their jobs and I didn't want to end up like that. By the end of my five years I had accomplised a lot.  I had received awards and praise and was even promoted to Science Department Chair, by all appearances, I was a rising star, but I still quit.  Here are my reasons.

        <h3 class="blog-post__sub-title">
            1. What do you mean I have to buy my own dry erase markers?
        </h3>
        <p class="blog-post__paragraph">
            Teaching is the one job where you steal supplies from yourself and bring them to work.  In the beginning, I would pay for the things I wanted to use in class thinking of them as investments that I would continue to use in the future (lol).  But things break, teenagers are clumsy and/or purposefully destructive and I eventually decided that I shouldn't have to pay for the materials to do my job.  Unfortunately, this resulted in my classes gradually getting less fun year after year.
        </p>
        <h3 class="blog-post__sub-title">
            2. Pay Schedules
        </h3>
        <p class="blog-post__paragraph">
            Some people like the predictability of pay schedules.  It (mostly) guarantees a raise<sup>2</sup> every year, but I found them very demotivating. I just had to make sure I didn't get fired and I'd know how much I would make the following year.  It didn't matter how many letters of recommendation that I wrote that helped my students get into top-tier schools and land great scholarships. It didn't matter how many of my students got 5's on their AP exams. Teaching just doesn't have a way of consistently rewarding high-performing teachers. So, I started to look elsewhere to a different career path that could and would reward me for my hard work.

        <h3 class="blog-post__sub-title">
            3. General disrespect from students builds up over time
        </h3>
        <p class="blog-post__paragraph">
            In general, throughout my teaching career, I had a great rapport with my students.  I genuinely liked them as people and there was a lot of mutual respect. But even with an overall positive experience, teenagers can be real jerks.  They try to get away with everything.  They lie straight to your face.  They get mad at you when you won't bend the rules for them.  They say things in anger.  At my first high school, usually, when a kid was being unreasonable, they would realize they were in the wrong and apologize the next day or when they got detention, but at my second school, a kid would act crazy and then look at me like I was the one being the asshole.  That's not to say I hate teenagers, but when you spend your entire working hours surrounded by them and most of your stress comes from them, it builds up over time. If the other aspects of the job weren't as taxing, I could have dealt with this aspect much better, but gradually, your patience wears thin and the problem never goes away.
        </p>
        <h3 class="blog-post__sub-title">
            4. General disrespect for the profession
        </h3>
        <p class="blog-post__paragraph">
            There isn't much prestige in being a teacher these days.  The press talks about teachers with open disdain and teachers get blamed for every problem in the k12 education system.  There's a finite number of headlines and articles I can read that demonize my job and theres only so many insults or back-handed comments about teaching I can hear and I reached my limit.  I was tired of defending my job when all I wanted to do was get students excited about science.
        </p>
        <h3 class="blog-post__sub-title">
            5. Inability to take time off when you need it
        </h3>
        <p class="blog-post__paragraph">
            People always act like a teacher's schedule is so nice because they get summers off, but many teachers pick up a second job during the summer to make ends meet.  Personally, I never picked up a second job over the summers because my partner has always had a well-paying job, but teachers shouldn't have to rely on a partner for financial stability! Furthermore, during the school year, teachers regularly work up to 12 hour days, bring work home with them, and can't ever really take time off when they need or want it. Get invited to Germany to do Oktoberfest with your friends? Your cousin is getting married in Italy? Too bad, can't go. As a teacher, you both can't take the time off and probably can't afford to go anyway.
            <br>
            <br>
            At my first school, we got three personal days a year. At my second job we didn't get any personal days, only sick days.  I barely used my sick days because it was more work to set up plans for a substitute than it was to just go into school and teach.  With a schedule where I only saw my students every other day, taking a day off usually set back progress a lot, so I never felt like I could take a day off without being stressed out the entire time.  This specific change has resulted in the greatest quality of life improvement since quitting.
        </p>
        <h3 class="blog-post__sub-title">
            6. I didn't want to enforce rules I didn't believe in
        </h3>
        <p class="blog-post__paragraph">
            I do not care about dress codes.  I'm actually pretty against them. I hate how they restrict the creative expression of girls and don't address the fact that we should just be teaching young men to be respectful.  There were a lot of rules and systems in place that were ineffective, illogical, or even harmful.  It was my job to enforce these rules but it would create tension because it would erode away at the relationships I built with my students. They would view me as the bad guy, and it was a fair point, with some of the rules, I was the bad guy.  Enforcing rules that reinforce sexist gender norms sets up a confrontational dynamic that was counter productive to building relationships and providing a psychologically safe environment for students at school.
        </p>
        <h3 class="blog-post__sub-title">
            7. Most of my time wasn't actually spent teaching
        </h3>
        <p class="blog-post__paragraph">
            The actual time spent teaching versus doing other things as a teacher isn't as high as most people think.  More time is spent planning, grading, and in meetings than actual time in front of a class. Even when you are leading a class, a large portion of your energy is spent on behavior management rather than teaching (not all the time, but this is also highly variable depending on your school and your group of students).  The job title is 'Teacher' but by then end, I didn't feel like I was doing much teaching.  If teachers could actually spend the majority of their time and energy on teaching, I think I could have remained in that profession, but where k12 education currently stands, 3 years post-quitting, I'm so much happier and I've never looked back.

            Three reasons I chose software engineering as my next move.
        </h3>
        <p class="blog-post__paragraph">
            I spent a lot of time thinking about what to do next.  I needed a solid plan to get out of teaching, it's not like I saved up a lot of money to be able to take a break and then figure it out. It was scary throwing away all those years of experience and all the career progress I made.  I'm not sure exactly what the breaking point was, I just knew I needed out.  So a lot of soul searching and research eventually led me to pursue software development, and here is reason number 1...
        </p>
        <h3 class="blog-post__sub-title">
            1. Honestly, the pay
        </h3>
        <p class="blog-post__paragraph">
            Tech salaries are waaaayyyyy better than anything I'd ever make as a teacher.  I like having nice things.  I enjoy taking trips.  Being a teacher would never allow me to have the kind of life I want. I think it's a total scam that we expect teachers to solve all of society's problems while paying mediocre salaries and expecting them to have master's degrees. It's just not worth it. This is a reason a lot of people pursue a career in tech, but it's important to choose a job where you'll be challenged and fulfilled. Which leads me to reason number 2...

        <h3 class="blog-post__sub-title">
            2. I find problem solving is fun
        </h3>
        <p class="blog-post__paragraph">
            One thing I really enjoyed about physics is problem solving and I'm still able to apply that skill in coding. When I'm doing something I enjoy, it doesn't feel like a grind.  Coding is hard, but there is always a solution.  There's usually more than one solution.  I find it very satisfying to work through them.
        </p>
        <h3 class="blog-post__sub-title">
            3. It's a job that allows me to be both technical and creative
        </h3>
        <p class="blog-post__paragraph">
            Growing up I felt like I had to be either analytical or creative but I eventually realized that I need to exercise both of those skills to be fulfilled.  Web development is the perfect intersection of those for me.  I love the visual aspect of front end and enjoy the puzzle of coding in less visual languages.

        <p class="blog-post__paragraph">
            In my <a href="/blog/from-teacher-to-tech-part-2">next post</a>, I'll get more into why I chose a Bootcamp instead of self-education or going back to get another degree and my Bootcamp experience.

                <sup>1</sup> Mediocre salary can mean different things to different people.  My starting salary as a teacher with a Master's Degree was in the ballpark of $52,000 which might not seem that bad, but Northern Virgina is a very expensive place to live.
            </p>

            <p>
                <sup>2</sup> In reality, sometimes the overall compensation year over year was worse instead of better when they cut benefits or raised insurance costs.  In other districts sometimes there were step freezes when the budgets didn't get passed.  I never had any of these scenarios happen to me but they can be common depending on location.
