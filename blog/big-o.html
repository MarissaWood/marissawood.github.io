            To be honest, it took  me a long time to actually sit down and learn Big O.  My bootcamp only spent one morning on it and then we pretty much never talked about it again.  For my first two jobs, the interviews didn't ask about it.  Although, I should note, that I failed a handful of other interviews because I didn't know it and companies with huge amounts of users and data require it.

            When you are working on web applications that don't have thousands of users or data points to work with, there are plenty of other things that you can spend your time learning and mastering that will probably serve you better.  However, at a certain point, not knowing the time or space complexity of your code starts to become a problem and hold you back.  So, after three and a half years of working as a software dev, I finally decided to learn it for real. And it wasn't that bad! So I'll try my best to put the important parts into a succinct post for anyone else who has been procrastinating on learning Big O or who hasn't successfully figured it out from previous articles/blogs/textbooks. This will be a good primer if you are just starting to learn Big O Notation as well as a good review if you learned it a really long time ago and want to brush up before an interview.

        <p class="blog-post__paragraph">
            Big O Notation is a framework that software engineers use to describe the complexity of code in mathematical terms.  We use it to compare the effiency of different approaches to a problem.  It lets you know how scalable a solution is.  In plain language, it tells you how the runtime will change with respect to the input size.  The good news is that we simplify all the math down into really simple terms.   You don't have to perform a formal mathematical proof to find the big O notation of an algorithm, you just have to understand the broad strokes of the functions and inputs in your code.

            Time Complexity and Space Complexity
        </h3>
        <p class="blog-post__paragraph">
            When discussing the complexity of code, there are two times, time and space.  Most of the time we are discussing the time complexity because that has the biggest impact to the end user of our software.
