            This is the third and final part of my series on how I transitioned from high school teacher to software engineer.  If you want to know more about why I quit teaching, check out <a href="/blog/from-teacher-to-tech-part-1">part 1</a>.

            So, I made the decision to change careers, attended a bootcamp and the real difficult part was next: finding a job.  As of the time of this posting I am in my second software job so I'll talk about landing the first one and the second one.  Everyone's career path will look different.  It can take people months and even up to a year to land their first software job.

            Why is it so hard to land a junior software developer/engineer job?

        <p class="blog-post__paragraph">
            I don't really have any answers as to why this seems to be so difficult.  It took me two months of devoting about 30 hours a week to applying and interviewing before I started my first role which was a full stack developer at a small (5 person) software agency.  I started out as a contractor for about a month before getting hired as a full-time employee with benefits.  This was not the type of role I envisioned when I set out on my job search.  If I'm being completely honest, I took a small pay cut from my last teaching job to my first software job<sup>1</sup>.  But I gained so much valuable experience and had a much better work-life balance.  Even with the pay cut it was worth it to change industries for me.  If you are coming from a different situation, and a better paying job, you may have to take a significantly lower salary to start out, but 2-3 years down the line, after you gain experience, so many more opportunities open up and your salary potential goes way up.

            How my bootcamp helped with my job search
        </h3>

        <p class="blog-post__paragraph">
            I graduated from General Assembly's Web Development Immersive (now renamed to Software Engineering Immersive) and they built in sessions once a week for us to work on getting ready for our job search at the end of the program.  We revamped our resumes and LinkedIn profiles.  We took professional headshots for our linkedin and personal portfolio websites.  We did practice interviews.  We did exercises to help narrow down our ideal role.  We had a career coach look over our cover letters.  We had panels with GA alumni where we could ask questions and get advice. We even had a field trip to a local start up to get a glimpse of a day in the life of a developer.  Post-graduation, we were encouraged to continue to come to campus to work on applications and had weekly check-ins with a career coach until we landed a job or voluntarily stop using that resource.  General Assembly used to have profiles of alumni available on their website for employers to look at, and this is actually how I got my first job, but upon searching for it today, it appears that they have discontinued this and partnered with hired and vettery instead.

            All of this was very helpful.  But I still found it very difficult to get my first job.

            My job search
        </h3>

        <p class="blog-post__paragraph">
            Keeping in mind that everyone is different, here is  a breakdown of how my job search panned out.  My program ended on August 3rd and I started my first job September 26. It took slightly less than two months, which doesn't sound that bad, but it was the longest, most grueling two months of my life.  It was two months of rejection.  Two months of attending meet ups and trying my best to network.  Two months of spending hours on LinkedIn and every job board I could think of.  Two months of writing cover letters and filling out applications.  Two months of followup after phone screens.  Two months of going to every job fair<sup>2</sup> I could find.  Two months of griding away on practice coding challenging on leetcode and other similar websites.  According to my spreadsheet tracker I applied to 60 different jobs. (I continued to apply to new postings while I was working as a contractor so these were spread out over 3 months).  I had about 7 phone screens, then 4 companies invited me to a phone or video interview or take home code challenge and only 2 invited me for in-person interviews.

            My first job as a developer

        <p class="blog-post__paragraph">
            After all of the applying and interviewing I finally got an offer.  It wasn't ideal but I was really in the pits of hell and willing to take almost any job that where I thought I could learn and grow.  Originally I wanted to be at a more established company with big software teams and lots of structure and people to learn from.  At my job there were only 2 devs.  One was leaving for a new job so I had about 3 weeks of overlap but I was basically taking his place.

            There are a lot of reasons to move on from your first role.  But I knew it was time to move on when the benefits of my role (compensation, etc.) were no longer compoetitive for my experience.  This

                <sup>1</sup> I made about $2500 less per year in my first software job than my last teaching job.

                <sup>2</sup> I still go to job fairs whenever I hear about them even if I'm not actively looking for a job.  Its a good way to network (which I find very difficult), and, more importantly, you get a bunch of free swag.  Give me all the free stickers, notebooks, pens, and tshirts, thank you!
